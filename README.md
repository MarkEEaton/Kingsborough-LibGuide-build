# Kingsborough-LibGuide-build

### I have rolled some of the changes from this repo into [Kingsborough-LibGuide](https://github.com/MarkEEaton/Kingsborough-LibGuide), and have now stopped maintaining this repo.


These are the pieces needed to build the JS for our Kingsborough-LibGuide. My approach is to use Vue's single-file components to structure the code.

You can run the build with `$ node build.js`. You will have to install some dependencies for this to work.
